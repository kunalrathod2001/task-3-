            <h1>Biography</h1>
            <p>Dr. K Sivan served as the Secretary, Department of Space, Chairman, Space Commission and Chairman, Indian
                Space Research Organisation (ISRO) from January 2018 to January 2022.

                Dr. K Sivan joined ISRO in 1982 and was inducted into PSLV Project. He is specialised in Aerospace
                engineering, Space Transportation Systems Engineering, Launch vehicle and mission design, control &
                guidance design and mission simulation software design, Mission synthesis, simulation, analysis and
                validation of flight systems.

                He has significantly contributed towards end-to-end mission planning, design, integration and analysis.
                His innovative contributions, particularly the strategies adopted in mission design enabled the
                consistent performance of PSLV. This has also proved to be a good foundation for other launch vehicles
                of ISRO, like, GSLV MkII & MkIII including RLV-TD. He is the chief architect of 6D trajectory simulation
                software, SITARA, which is the backbone of the real-time and non-real-time trajectory simulations of all
                ISRO launch vehicles. He was responsible for commissioning world-class simulation facility in ISRO for
                mission synthesis and analysis, which is used for mission design, sub-system level validation and
                integrated validation of avionics systems in all ISRO launch vehicles. He developed and implemented an
                innovative 'day-of launch wind biasing strategy' that enables rocket launch on any day, under varied
                weather and wind conditions. He was the chief mission architect for successful launch of 104 satellites
                in a single mission of PSLV.

                He has received many awards including Doctor of Science (Honoris Causa) from selected universities.

                He has numerous publications in various reputed Journals including a book in Nov 2015 “Integrated Design
                for Space Transportation System” published by Springer.</p>
